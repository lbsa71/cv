Stefan,Andersson,,,"Feb 16, 1971","Jack of all IT trades, master of quite a few","Stefan is the ideal cornerstone hire for ambitious initiatives and emerging ventures.  With 35+ years of experience across diverse tech stacks and organizational levels, he has become a founder's Swiss army knife - a one-man matrix organization. His versatility spans strategic vision to tactical execution, making him invaluable for teams transitioning from concept to reality.  While primarily focused on SaaS, Web, and Virtual worlds solutions, Stefan has repeatedly ventured into low-level development - from 3D engines and broadcasting to firmware and industrial process control.  Stefan thrives on urgency and meaningful challenges: becoming CTO for Norway TV2 Teletext at 22, pioneering early Web development (creating a CMS for the Swedish Board of Education before 'CMS' was a thing), and founding multiple cutting-edge ventures, including a major first-wave 3D Web open source platform. His journey later led through Enterprise Business Intelligence, where he discovered his passion for analytics, to serving as CISO for healthcare solutions. Today, he's come full circle, contributing to the second wave of 3D Web innovation.",Computer Games,42834,"Gothenburg, Västra Götaland County, Sweden",[lbsa71],"[OTHER:https://hiberworld.com/u/Stefan,OTHER:https://soundcloud.com/lbsa71]",
